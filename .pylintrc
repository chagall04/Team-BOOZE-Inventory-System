[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable specific warnings that are false positives or not applicable to test code
disable=
    # Test-specific patterns that are intentional
    unused-argument,        # Pytest fixtures often appear unused (mock_print, mock_input, etc.)
    redefined-outer-name,   # Pytest fixtures intentionally redefine names
    import-outside-toplevel, # Tests often import inside functions for isolation
    too-few-public-methods, # Test classes don't need multiple methods

    # Code complexity warnings that are acceptable in this project
    too-many-arguments,     # Some functions legitimately need many parameters (especially tests)
    too-many-positional-arguments, # Related to above
    too-many-branches,      # record_sale() has complex flow which is clear
    too-many-return-statements, # validate_numeric_value has clear validation logic

    # Formatting issues
    trailing-whitespace,    # Handled by editor auto-format
    line-too-long,          # Set to 120, some test lines legitimately exceed

    # Documentation warnings (already have docstrings where needed)
    missing-function-docstring, # Not all test functions need docstrings

    # Other acceptable patterns
    fixme,                  # TODO/FIXME comments are intentional placeholders
    unnecessary-pass,       # Placeholder tests use pass statements
    unused-variable,        # Some test return values intentionally unused (_result, _product, etc.)
