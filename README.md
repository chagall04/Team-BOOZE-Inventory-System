# Team BOOZE Inventory System

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the Liquor Store Inventory Management System, a project for the Software Engineering 3 module.

The system is designed to provide core inventory tracking, product management, and sales processing for a small-to-medium-sized liquor store. Development follows an agile process, emphasizing code quality, thorough testing, and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD).

## Features

The **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** is structured around four core functionalities:

-   **Product Management**: Functions to add, view, and update products in the catalog.
-   **Inventory Tracking**: Logic to manage stock levels (receiving new shipments, logging losses).
-   **Sales Transaction Management**: Processing sales and recording transaction history.
-   **Reporting & Analytics**: Generating basic reports, such as low-stock and total inventory value.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/chagall04/Team-BOOZE-Inventory-System.git](https://github.com/chagall04/Team-BOOZE-Inventory-System.git)
    cd Team-BOOZE-Inventory-System
    ```

2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage
